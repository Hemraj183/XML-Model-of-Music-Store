# XML-Model-of-Music-Store
As an XML developer, I made the model a music store sytem.
After an interview with the store manager you have the following information:

- The details of the store include store name, address, telephone number, website address (URL), and logo (image).</li>
- The song has a genre and other properties like name of the director, producer,writer, singer(s), release year and so on.
- A genre of music is a traditional category that describes certain music pieces a belonging to a particular tradition or collection of conventions. Some popular genres are Jazz, Rock, Country Music, Pop Music, and Dubstep.
 
        
## Task 1.
Analyse the above-motioned scenario. Prepare data in XML, and add additional
information you wish to record. Draw your document structure (tree diagram). You should
include:
- At least 15 data
- At least 5 attributes
- At least 5 optional elements(marks will be awarded according to the data required in scenario)

## Task 2.
Using the above and additional information, and the data structure from Task 1, create
an XML document and name it catalog_studentID.xml. (e.g. catalog_03047791.xml).
(use real time scenario for better marks).

## Task 3.
Based on the structure of catalog_studentID.xml, create a schema file(external) named
catalog_studentID.xsd and dtd file named catalog_studentID.dtd. Apply
catalog_studentID.xsd to the contents of catalog_studentID.xml. Validate the XML
document against your DTD and Schema using an online validator such as
http://www.xmlvalidation.com.

## Task 4.
Create a CSS file called catalog_studentID.css to render your XML data file in a web browser.
- Create a list
- Create at least one border
- Use at least two different font sizes and font families.
- Use two different font colors, at least one of which is defined using RGB values.
- Display the logo image.
- Use at least one floating box
